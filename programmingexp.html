        <h5>History:</h5>
        <p>
          My first foray into coding really began on Neopets. For those
          unfamiliar, Neopets is a website in a similar vein as Tamagotchi pets,
          where you choose and care for a virtual pet. There, I set up the HTML
          links for a mall that I ran by mapping them to marketing images I
          created. The "malls" on the site were player creations that joined
          eight or so shops together; each receiving the benefit of traffic from
          the others. Being the entrepreneurial spirit that I am, I went one
          step further and positioned myself as head of a single mall consisting
          of multiple smaller malls, whereby I could have around 30 stores
          linking to my shop and generating about 500k Neopoints per day. Greedy
          much?
        </p>
        <p>
          While running my own company Cyberburn, I leveraged and extended this
          knowledge. There, I wrote the product pages and dabbled in the SEO for
          my websites. While this was only dipping my toe into the programming
          world, it did pique my interest and it became something that I always
          wanted to study but never seemed to have the time to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon entering my first corporate position at BlackRock, I used SQL
          daily. I quickly discovered that this was the most enjoyable part of
          the job and spent most of my time studying SQL and writing queries.
          This interest continued at Bridgewater where I not only continued to
          use SQL, albeit sparingly, but also built bespoke analytical models.
          The models within Finance use the same analytical frameworks as
          putting together good, clean code. This has assisted me significantly
          as I study and improve my programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          After leaving Bridgewater, I decided to give programming my all. From
          here I have gone through FreeCodeCamp.org's courses as well as Colt
          Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp and The Modern React Bootcamp on
          Udemy. I continue to study daily and am currently targeting data
          structure and algorithm knowledge. I also volunteer for the League of
          Amazing Programmers. Which is a wonderful non-profit that teaches kids
          how to code in Java and gives them the opportunity to study to be a
          software engineer while still in highschool! If you wish to learn more
          about this wonderful orgranization click
          <a href="https://www.jointheleague.org/" target="blank">HERE</a>. I
          absolutely love learning programming and already have far too many
          ideas that I wish to implement, this site being the first.
