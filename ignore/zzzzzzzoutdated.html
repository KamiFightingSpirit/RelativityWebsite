      <h3>About This Site:</h3>
      <p>
        Hello and thanks for taking the time to visit my site! To get right to
        it, the big idea is that you are an astronaut (or Space Cowboy for
        fellow Cowboy Bebop fans) exploring the universe and experiencing the
        fascinating effects of time dilation; a favorite subject of mine. The
        site itself walks you through my professional experience, which you can
        do by clicking on the different planets in the solar system. As each of
        the planets covers a period of my life and the amount of time you take
        to go through the site covers a period in yours, I thought it would be
        fun to explore that relative time cost.
      </p>
      <h4>How it Works:</h4>
      <p>
        By clicking a planet to read a portion of the site the "External Time"
        portion of the top banner will increase. Additionally, for every two
        seconds you remain on the site a day passes on your hypothetical
        intergalactic ship. I chose two seconds for simplicities sake as it
        roughly makes a minute equal a month.
      </p>
      <h4>Why:</h4>
      <p>
        Most importantly, this was my first major project as I continue to learn
        web development and improve my programming skills. As such, it is an
        educational tool and also a piece of my portfolio for others to see.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an educational tool it has been incredible. I didn't set out thinking
        I would do something within the animation realm but it took that path as
        my goal was ambitious. This meant learning the frameworks for Web GL as
        well as the Pixi.js library that I used for the graphical elements on
        the site. While more of a niche for most web development work, the same
        programming frameworks are universal.
