3. Add a planet DONE 03/12
4. Rotate the planet around the sun DONE 03/12
5. Add the planets atmosphere (may differ from the corona setup) DONE 03/13
7. Make the planet stop when hover DONE 03/16
8. Make the planet restart when stopped hovering DONE 03/16
10. Add an info box upon hovering DONE 03/15
13. Add in the navbar DONE 03/17
21. Add setting for planet's initial positioning (Can set via the STEP attribute) DONE 03/16
25. Make the Navbar always collapsable hamburger DONE 03/17
29. Randomize planet's initial position DONE 03/19
24. Fix bridgewater' texture frame glitching at start DONE 03/18
19. Get everything to accurately reposition upon resize DONE 03/19
9. Test how adding an orbital line looks DONE 03/19
12. Add multiple planets DONE 03/19
17. Load the images properly via loader DONE 03/19
20. Set z-index of info boxes to always be highest DONE 03/20
22. Solve the whole delta/step problem with DONE 03/16
28. understand z-index and see if you can shrink the orbits. DONE 03/20
30. Add in an animated background (LARGEST NICE TO HAVE BUT WILL USE EVERYWHERE) DONE 04/06
33. Cleanup the event listeners section DRY CODE  DONE 03/27
35. look to see if isometry plane is necessary of if everything should be inside of the planetContainer instead. DONE 03/22
36. Make the blinking of the stars have an easy speed control DONE 03/22
38. Make the stars have a maxScale based off their random initial scale (note: rejected - max is randomized via initial anyays) DONE 03/22
39. Try out having multiple images for stars to see if it makes a significant impact? Might just be a nice to have DONE 03/22
40. GOOD: Add dynamic starry background DONE 03/22 
41. Fade the suicide stars out DONE 03/22
42. Get the star background to adjust on window resize DEPRECATED - will resize the entire renderer
44. Completely redo file strucuture DONE 04/29
43. link the landing page to the home page DONE 04/29
45. Add in the Relativity toolbar DONE 05/13
57. Rename all planet variables and images to be more consistent with content DONE 05/15
58. Add in Back/Refresh button DONE 05/16


TO DO:
11. Create a create planet function
15. Create a function that creates info boxes for planets
16. Begin work on individual page view
26. Write in the navbar links
27. Add the links to the hover effects.
31. Get rid of the random 200 in texture ticker update
32. Properly adjust the wordWrapWidth on info boxes
34. Add in contact me icons in navbar
46. resize the homes renderer on screen resize.
59. See if there is a way to get sessionStorage to keep its content even if the browser back button is used
60. Fix the texture scrolling issue in Edge
61. Put a warning up for IE
62. Make the time dilation calc more robust


NICE TO HAVES:
GOOD: Add in additional hover effects for planets (highlighting, etc)
1. Make everything resize on screen resize
2. Add a text animation effect on planets 
3. Make the resize happen when you drop down the nav
4. Make the texture frame wiggle up and down
5. Add shading to the planet
6. Make a planet texture move backwards without glitching
7. Make orbit lines look better in terms of zindex (not sure...)
8. Maybe work on the random function for the planets initial positioning... have some sort of a guaranteed space between them
9. Create a random shooting star effect
11. Get rid of stars that spawn on orbital lines
